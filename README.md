# Road_Traffic_Sign_Detection_and_Recognition

### Project Description
- Employed YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, in combination with a custom CNN. This innovative approach
successfully detected and accurately classified various German traffic signs across 43 distinct classes.
- Advanced computer vision techniques, including image augmentation, transfer learning, and feature extraction, to enhance
the precision of predicting the top 3 potential traffic sign candidates for assisting the driver to take more informed decision.
-  Seamlessly integrated Python, TensorFlow, and YOLOv5 for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction workflows.
- Achieved optimal performance and accuracy by fine-tuning YOLOv5 on the traffic sign dataset and solved problems such as
class imbalance, dataset quality, and model optimization ensuring output class prediction from the raw input image.
